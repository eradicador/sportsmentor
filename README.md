# SportsMentor

## Description
As developers we created a MERN application, the application will allow users to watch and learn how to play different sports. Users will be able to register an account with their email and password. Then they will be taken to the StudyUp page where they will see cards for different sports, when they click on one of them they will be taken to the tutorial page for that specific sport where they can read about the tecniques for that sport as well as to watch videos for those tecniques so they can practice them. Each card has a save button which when they hit it will save that card in the user's dashboard. In the users dashboard they will be able to see the cards they saved from the studyUp page and when they finish with that specific sport they can hit the complete button which will change the card to green color, meaning that they are done with that sport. The application's UI is divided into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
